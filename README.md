# tracker

A web analytics platform that I developed during a course in backend web programming.

Project includes:
  - A datahandler that stores event data in MongoDB.
  - An API for extracting aggregated reports per account and site such as:
    - Page views per URL and day
    - Visitors per day
    - Browsers per day
  - A web GUI to visualize the report data and manage an account (adding new sites, getting the Javascript tag etc.)
